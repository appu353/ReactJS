      Code in React | create-react-app:-is utility or basically software. But
      this utility is bulky and it will take time to create project. It will
      install unnecessary things to our system. Command for creating project
      is:- npx create-react-app project name.(node js should be installed) To
      run project:-npm run start or npm start. Local host port number is 3000.
      npm run build:- command to run in production. Build folder will be created
      and code will get converted into JS. Build folder will be served to the
      user in production, not src folder. Creating project with create-react-app
      is bulky way of creating project. So we will use Vite to create project.
      Create react project using Vite. Vite is bundler.

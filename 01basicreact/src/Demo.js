//Short Notes:-
//Always write function in capital letter.It will not throw an error but project won't run.
//Vite library will throw an error but create-react-app will not throw.
//Always create component with capital letter for good practice.It will not throw any error.
//Create-react-app:-no need to write extension as jsx but both will work.
//If only JS code is present then we will write its extension as JS and if it is returining HTML the will write JSX extension.
// but in vite willl force us  to write JSX not JS.(otherwise it will throw an error)
//Vite will also force us to write function in capital letter

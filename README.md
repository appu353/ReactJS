# ReactJS

## React.js, more commonly known as React, is a free, open-source JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites. Originally built by Facebook, Meta and the open-source community now maintain it. One of the good things about React is that you can use it as much or as little as you want! For example, you can build your entire site in React or just use one single React component on one page
